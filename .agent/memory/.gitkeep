# Memory Directory

This directory stores decision logs and significant learnings.

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

Examples:
- `2025-01-15-auth-strategy.md` - Why we chose JWT over sessions
- `2025-02-03-database-migration.md` - How we migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
- `2025-03-10-performance-fix.md` - Solution to N+1 query problem

Each file should document:
- **Context**: What was the situation?
- **Problem**: What needed to be solved/decided?
- **Analysis**: What options were considered?
- **Decision**: What was chosen?
- **Outcome**: What happened as a result?
- **Learnings**: What would we do differently?

Keep files focused (20-100 lines each) and create new files for new topics.
